title: Future projects I'm thinking about

I haven't really had much time to do anything cool in the past year, mainly because I'm currently in the process of applying to colleges. These ideas have been marinating in my mind for the past couple of months and I think it would be a good idea to write them down before I forget.

#### Aquarium related
- Making a mini barrel pond for Medaka (Oryzias latipes). They're really pretty fish with a lot of history, and some of the breeds look iridescent :D 

- App for managing aquarium tasks (might get this done soon tbh)

- Auto fertilization/top offs + building an inkbird

#### Gardening related

- Carnivorous plant raised bed/barrel

#### Music related
- Song rec website (select by country, genre, listener count, etc)
- Writing some music, learning guitar

#### Other
