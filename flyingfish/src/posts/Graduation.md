#### Graduation
Yesterday I graduated from high school. It's surreal to know that I won't ever return to the life that I've lived for the past decade. There are friends that I will lose contact with. There are places I will never get to see again. It's a new start in that sense, I guess. I've always felt like I've needed a new start -- I've always felt kind of distant from my friends. I wasn't able to connect as well as others did because I was at the doctor's so much until junior year, and most of my friends live on the other side of town so I cant see them much outside of school. 

On that note, expect more stuff to be put on this site in the next few months, provided that I don't forget about it again LMAO
