A few months ago I bought an old lab microscope off of ebay, so I could get a better look at the organisms inside of the aquariums. <br>

After setting it up, I realized that I didn't have a way to record video through it. There was another model which was was trinocular and would have allowed be to easily attach a camera to the top, but I wasn't able to find a definitively working one for sale. I ended up 3d-printing this mount for my phone.
