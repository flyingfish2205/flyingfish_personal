The shrimp have been doing pretty well so far. They're relatively low maintenance, I just top off the tank with distilled water and throw in a piece of broccoli every now and then and they seem to thrive. I wouldn't recommend them as a first pet (It took me three tries to get the water quality right), but once you get everything dialed in they seem to be happy on their own. I've already counted at least 3 generations of shrimp, and there are at least 30 in the tank now. I'll probably go back to cuboid to get some different colors of shrimp (and maybe some ricefish) in the future, now that everything seems to have stabilized.

Here are some pictures that I said I would post in September:
