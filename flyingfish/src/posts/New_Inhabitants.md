The shrimp tank has grown a lot since I last posted. The plants have grown significantly (especially the water lettuce and dwarf sag).  Some plant’s I didn’t even know I had started showing up as well, like duckweed, which is a pain to remove. The pearlweed unfortunately melted away, leaving me with a cooked-spinach like goop on the bottom of my tank. Thankfully the snails and copepods made quick work of the mess.

Before I even had the chance to add shrimp, animal life had started to appear in the tank. Copepods were the first to show up, and soon I began seeing Rhabdocoela, a type of flatworm.  Without any competition or predators, their populations exploded.  

The plants I got also came with some unexpected hitchhikers - 6 tiny ramshorn snails, barely bigger than a pinhead. They were a welcome surprise, and quickly dealt with most algae in the tank.

There’s also this weird floating mass of what looks like some kind of fern. Hopefully I can 

After testing the water (and ensuring that the Kh was correct, something I learned the hard way), I picked up 5 Red Rili shrimp from Cuboid Aquariums. They’ve got a great selection of fish and plants, as well as some really neat display tanks. Really worth checking out if you’re in the New Hope area.

Three of the shrimp were berried when I got them, and soon enough I found tiny baby shrimp all around the tank. Unfortunately, a few days after this, I noticed two dead shrimp in my tank. I suspect this was because I topped off the water in the tank too fast. As of now, I suspect that there are 3 of the original shrimp remaining, but one has been MIA for a couple of days now.

The babies have grown a lot since they first hatched. Most of them are around a centimeter long now. I’m trying to feed them more so I can hopefully get an established colony soon.

[UPDATE: as I was writing this, the final two adults have unfortunately perished. The babies however, are thriving]

Will attach pictures soon :)
