Hey! I'm flyingfish, or flyingfish2205 depending on which platform you're on. I'm interested in biology, and I'm an avid fishkeeper and aquascaper. I'm also a lifelong New Jerseyan(Jerseyite?), and consequently have a deep-rooted love for tomatoes. 

Bands I like:
- They Might Be Giants
- King Gizzard and the Lizard Wizard
- Ween
- Kero Kero Bonito
- The Cure
- Streetlight Manifesto
- Catch 22
- Gojira


What I'm reading right now:
- The Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy
