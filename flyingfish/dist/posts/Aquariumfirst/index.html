<p>If I'm going to track my progress, I've got to establish a baseline first. Here's what my aquariums look like as of 7/30/2024.
I've got a bunch of updates planned including:</p>
<ul>
<li>More plants</li>
<li>New stocking (Corydoras!)</li>
<li>Auto top off, water change, and fertilizer systems</li>
</ul>
<p>Future Shrimp Tank:</p>
<div>
<img src = "/assets/img/shrimp_tank_baseline.png" width = "50%" length = "50%">
</div>
<p>Community Tank:</p>
<div>
<img src = "/assets/img/community_tank_baseline.jpg" width = 50% length = "50%">
</div>
<p>As you can probably tell, they need some work (especially the community tank). I'd like to do both in a more jungle style with lots of plants.</p>
