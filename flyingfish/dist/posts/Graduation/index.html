		<h1>Graduation</h1>
		<h4>Graduation</h4>
<p>Yesterday I graduated from high school. It's surreal to know that I won't ever return to the life that I've lived for the past decade. There are friends that I will lose contact with. There are places I will never get to see again. It's a new start in that sense, I guess. I've always felt like I've needed a new start -- I've always felt kind of distant from my friends. I wasn't able to connect as well as others did because I was at the doctor's so much until junior year, and most of my friends live on the other side of town so I cant see them much outside of school.</p>
<p>I almost feel empty now. There's nothing I really have to do (other than some paperwork for college). All my life I've had some goal, something to work towards, but now there's nothing but stuff I want to do. And I've kinda conditioned myself to avoid working on personal projects (like this website) over the past two years because every time I did my parents would tell me to do something &quot;useful&quot;, so now I just scroll reels and feel unfulfilled. I guess it's finally time to break that habit.</p>
<p>On that note, expect more stuff to be put on this site in the next few months, provided that I don't forget about it again LMAO</p>
